📘 DPP on Loops — 1

A curated problem set designed to practice and strengthen concepts of loops in C++, including for, while, arithmetic progressions (AP), geometric progressions (GP), and logic building.

📂 Contents

This Daily Practice Problem (DPP) sheet is divided into two major sections:

Section A — Coding Questions

Basic to intermediate looping problems that require writing complete C++ programs.

Section B — Predict the Output (Basic)

Small code snippets where you must analyze loop execution and determine the output—ideal for strengthening logic flow and dry-run skills.

🧠 Section A — Coding Questions

This section covers:

Print a string n times

Print numbers from 1 to n

Print numbers from n down to 1

Print all even numbers from 1 to n

Print all odd numbers from 1 to n

Take inputs a, d, n and print first n terms of AP

Print AP terms (e.g., 100, –97, –94…) but only positive values

Take inputs a, r, n and print first n terms of GP

Print numbers from 1 to n using a while loop

Print the sum of numbers from 1 to n

Print all multiples of 3 from 1 to n using a while loop

Print the factorial of n using a for loop

📝 Section B — Predict the Output (Basic)

These questions test understanding of:

for loops

while loops

Increment/decrement logic

Conditional checks inside loops

AP logic step-by-step

Dry-run skills

Example snippet types included:

-> for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    cout << i << " ";
}

-> int n = 4;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << i * 2 << " ";
}

-> int i = 3;
while (i > 0) {
    cout << i << " ";
    i--;
}

-> for (int i = 2; i <= 6; i += 2) {
    cout << i << " ";
}


…and many more covering conditions, AP updates, special print cases, and cumulative sum examples.

🎯 Learning Objectives

By solving this DPP, you will:

✔ Strengthen loop fundamentals (for, while)
✔ Understand iteration flow and boundary conditions
✔ Learn AP/GP generation using loops
✔ Improve debugging and dry-run skills
✔ Practice competitive programming basics

💻 Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of C++ syntax

Understanding of input/output

Familiarity with arithmetic sequences

Ability to trace loop execution

🚀 How to Use

Start with Section A and solve each problem in your preferred editor (VS Code, CodeBlocks, etc.)

Then move to Section B and predict outputs manually

Finally, run the code to verify your answers

Use this DPP daily to build strong loop-level mastery
